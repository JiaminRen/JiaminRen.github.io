I am currently a researcher in the [SenseTime](https://www.sensetime.com/), under the supervision of Assistant Prof. [Ping Luo](http://luoping.me/). <br>
I received the B.E. and M.S. degrees from [Harbin Institute of Technology(HIT)](http://www.hit.edu.cn/), Harbin, China in 2014 and 2017, respectively.

# Research
My research interests include computer vision, deep learning and robotics, with particular interest in the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics. <br>
